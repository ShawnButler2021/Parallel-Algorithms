# Parallel Algorithms
This repository contains my work for Designing Parallel Algorithms at Mississippi State University. It will include my notes, extra credit assignments, personal ventures, and homework projects. I created this repo to stay organized and showcase my work. Feel free to browse through the code and notes to see my progress!
